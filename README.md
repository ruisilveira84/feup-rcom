# Computer Networks 2023/2024

This repository contains the group projects for the [RCOM](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520330) course unit at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.inicial).

## Projects Developed

### 1. Data Link Protocol Implementation - [rc-proj1](rc-proj1)
This project involves the implementation of a file transfer protocol over a serial port.  
Through this work, we explored key challenges in designing data transfer protocols and examined trade-offs to optimize efficiency based on experimental results.

### 2. FTP Application and Network Configuration - [rc-proj2](rc-proj2)
This project includes the development of a file download application using the FTP protocol, along with the step-by-step configuration of a network for testing the application.  
Key topics such as IP, ARP, DNS, and NAT were explored, enabling a holistic understanding of both network setup and operation.
